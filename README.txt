OP3DT is a tool that automatically downloads the latest Python3 documentation, via Requests.
Currently it supports Windows and Linux, however hasn't been tested with all Linux distributions.
This requires Python3, and a web browser to view HTML files. If possible, occasionally a connection to the Internet for updates (this is not necessary at all however).
To start, install Python dependencies listed in requirements.txt, and run install.bat on Windows and install.sh on Linux.
Please note after installation you can safely delete this tool and on Windows its shortcut. It does not install itself into the operating system.

To check for documentation updates and new Github releases for OP3DT, run update.py.
A message box will return with the latest documentation version found and the version from last update check. Please select whether to update or not.

To access documentation, navigate to docs folder and look for index.html.

I started writing this in the 2 hours I had nothing to do before a online conference. I have no plans to support this project, and I have no idea why anyone would use it.
Feel free to mess around with it anyways.
